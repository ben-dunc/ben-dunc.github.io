        <p class="body">
            The BYU Engineering Leadership Certificate is a certificate award by the BYU Engineering College to students
            who complete a set of requirements designed to increase the leadership abilites of students. The
            requirements were:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Read 3 books on leadership and how to apply their principles to leadership.
            </li>
            <li>
                Participate in two leadership experiences of 30 or more hours within a class, club, or job and present
                the lessons learned to the ELC committee.
            </li>
        </ul>
        I was able to complete these requirements before graduating, receiving the ELC award at my graduating ceremony.

        <h3>My Experience</h3>
        My experience completing this award was very englightening and rewarding. Thought it was tough to find time, I
        was able to read the required books and lead my peers in two experiences. The books that I read were:
        <ul>
            <li>Outliers by Malcom Gladwell</li>
            <li>Mindset by Carrol Dweck</li>
            <li>???</li>
        </ul>
        For my leadership experiences, I had the opportunity to pioneer a new project in the BYU Spacecraft Club and
        lead a robotics team in BYU's first Battle Bots event. Click the links below to learn more about these
        experiences.
