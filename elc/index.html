            The BYU Engineering Leadership Certificate is a certificate award by the BYU Engineering College to students
            who complete a set of requirements designed to increase the leadership abilites of students. The
            requirements were:

            </li>
            <li>
                Participate in two leadership experiences of 30 or more hours within a class, club, or job and present
                the lessons learned to the ELC committee.

            I was able to complete these requirements before graduating, receiving the ELC award at my graduating
            ceremony.

        <h3>My Experience</h3>
        My experience completing this award was very englightening and rewarding. Thought it was tough to find time, I
        was able to read the required books and lead my peers in two experiences. The books that I read were:
        <ul>
            <li><i>Outliers: The Story Of Success</i> by Malcom Gladwell</li>
            <li><i>Mindset: The New Psychology of Success</i> by Carol S. Dweck</li>
            <li><i>Grit: The Power Of Passion And Perseverence</i> by Angela Duckworth</li>
        </ul>
        For my leadership experiences, I had the opportunity to pioneer a new project in the BYU Spacecraft Club and
        lead a robotics team in BYU's first Battle Bots event. Click the links below to learn more about these
        experiences.
