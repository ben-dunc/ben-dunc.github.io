        <h2 class="mt-0 pt-0">Experience #1 - BYU Spacecraft Club: Creating GPS & Camera Payloads For The Rocketry Club
        </h2>
        <p class="body">
            This project was a collaboration between the Spacecraft and Rocketry clubs at BYU. The goal was that the
            Spacecraft Club teams would create a payload for the rockets that the Rocketry Club teams were making. The
            payload was to include a real-time GPS module with base station communication as well as a camera to take
            photos during the flight.
        </p>
        <p class="body">
            My responsibility was both to collaborate with the Rocketry Club from a position within the Spacecraft Club
            and to teach & guide the underclassmen in creating the payloads. In addition, because this was the first
            time we've done this, I had to create the project from scratch, prototyping the systems and ensuring that
            they were reliable. I learned quite a few things during this project. The largest of which were:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Project management: I initially struggled with the project management aspect. It always seemed as though
                there was always less time than I had planned. It was initially difficult to coordinate with other busy
                individuals. I found solutions to each of these: overestimating project time and communicating well with
                others to meet up and coordinate.
            </li>
            <li>
                Part Reliability: There were several times that parts didn't function properly. I was able to come in
                and help out whenever such things happen. There was one Spacecraft team that didn't quite complete their
                project. The counterpart Rocketry team that relied upon them still needed their payload, so I helped out
                to ensure that the Rocketry team could complete their project. Although this dependency may seem like a
                weakness in the program, I personally found it to be an enlightening experience: this is how companies
                work in the industry. Different teams work on different areas of a project. If one team can't pull
                through, then the project as a whole suffers.
            </li>
            <li>
                Teaching: I had to outline the mechanical, electrical, and software system expectations to the teams. I
                provided some online resources, electrical parts, and my own experience for them to acheive their goal.
                However, I found teaching to be somewhat tough, particularly to my peers. I suffered from low
                self-esteem and wondered if they even needed to know what I was teaching them. Gratefully, I was able to
                learn to be more confident in my instruction and the content that I was teaching. They needed it.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="body">
            We had two teams participate in the program. Both of them completed the payload but encountered some
            difficulties along the way. The biggest challenges for me was mostly in coordination. Because some of the
            members were from the Rocketry Club and they were all busy with their classes. We met regularly to
            coordinate their work and ensure that they were on track. Below, you can see the photos that they were able
            to take in their rocket's flight.
