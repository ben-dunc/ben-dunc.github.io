# Benjamin Duncan - Portfolio
This project displays my projects to be seen in one, easy location. My hope is that I can generate some interest in the projects that I've worked on, whether such interest be fore job hiring, collaboration, learning, or feedback.

### My Proecess
I chose to make this website in simple HTML & CSS without any JavaScript to bring the simplest solution to my need. I didn't need any JavaScript nor did I need Angular, React, or a similar fancy JS framework. I could've used bootstrap for nice CSS styling but I prefered to do my own customization. At first, I attempted to use some very fancy css to make some parallaxed posterized gradients but I was struggling to get it working on mobile Safari on my old iPhone 8. In addition to that, the styling felt unprofessional, over the top, and had poor readiblity. So, I redid the styling, being inspired by the beautiful color schemes and fonts from common riced linux setups. I love the simplicity and beauty of such systems.

### What I learned
This project was fun for me! I enjoyed the simplicity and efficiency of simple HTML & CSS. I grew frustrated when my initial styling attempts were rendered differently accross different browsers. I suppose that it simply a challenge with web development. Once again, I found that doing things the simplest way is the easiest. I didn't need the complex CSS and I found a solution in efficient simplicity.
