            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p class="body">
                In 2024 I graduated from Brigham Young University with a degree in Computer Engineering.
                I am passionate about learning everything that I can to impact the world to be healthier, happier, and
                more
                efficient.
                Among my greatest goals is my desire to create higher educational opportunties for individuals in
                impovershed
                and low-opportuinty communities.
                I hold myself to integrity, understanding, and an open mind in order to communicate efficiently to my
                coworkers,
                peers, friends, and family.
            </p>
            <p class="body">
                I've enjoyed working in a variety of fields such as web development, integrated systems, analog
                circuits,
                and game development. Currently, I'm working as a techinical artist and programmer at Red Team
                Interactive,
                a growing indie game studio. I love learning new and efficient ways to create enjoyable and fun
                experiences
                for our users.
            </p>
            <p class="body">
                In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, coding, learning, reading books, and spending time with my
                wonderful wife. I'm currently playing through each of the Dark Souls games, after getting hooked on
                Elden
                Ring - fun! Project Hail Mary is the best book that I've read recently and I'm excited to watch the
                movie.
                My wife and I enjoy playing tennis, walking in nature, and watching anime with our cat.
