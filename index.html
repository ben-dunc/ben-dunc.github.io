    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Having graduated from Brigham Young University in Computer Engineering, I have been empassioned to create
        diverse, useful, and efficient applications, games, and products to leave a lasting and positive impact upon the
        world.
        I hold myself to integrity, understanding, and an open mind in order to interface and communicate simply &
        holistically to my coworkers, peers, friends, and family.
