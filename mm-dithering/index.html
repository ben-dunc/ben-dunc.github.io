            I was lucky enough to participate in the 2024 Mars Rover challenge with many talented students. The University
            Rover Challenge is an annual
            competition involving over 100 teams from 15 countries. BYU has done well in this competition in the past. In
            2024, we scored 3rd place.

        <!-- THE CHALLENGE -->
        <p class="body">
            The University Rover Challenge includes four parts: extreme delivery, autonomous navigation, equipement
            servicing, and a science task.
            You can find information about each of the missions <a target="_blank" href="https://urc.marssociety.org/home/requirements-guidelines">here</a>.
            My part was in the autonomy mission where the rover had to navigate autonomously to various GPS points. The
            terrain began smooth but quickly entered challenging rocky & hilly terrain.
            Not only did the rover need to navigate over this bumpy terrain with its mechanical rocker-bogey system but it
            also needed to avoid larger obstacles and steep hills that it couldn't handle directly. This was a major
            challenge for us. In addition to navigating this difficult terrain, the rover had to identify and approach
            different objects such as a water bottle and an orange mallet.

        <p class="body">
            In order to address these concerns, we opted for an obstacle detection system paired with an DNN object
            recognition system. The project itself is built
            in Python ROS (Robot Operating System) running on an NVidia Jetson Orin. I headed the obstacle detection system.
            Because this is a
            project that is passed from one
            graduating class to another, I started by fixing the old obstacle detection system that hadn't been touched for
            a few years. It was in pretty rough shape, throwing many false positives at random. The solution came about as I
            endeavored to understand, organize, and minimize the old code. Despite this being a new subject to me, I was
            able to understand how the object detection algorithm worked (Used OpenCV) and adjust the parameters to be
            capable of detecting hazardous objects in our path. Gratefully, the obstacle detection algorithm performed
            admirably.

        <!-- LESSONS -->
        <p class="body">
            I learned a lot during the course of this project. To be frank, I was a little surprised to be accepted into
            this sought after team. I learned so much from both my experiences as well as the people on the team itself. The
            dedication, interest, motivation, knowldge, and diligence that they showed have left a lasting impact on me. The
            project and techincal skills required taught me a lot as well. I had to learn about ROS, local networks, RF
            transmitters and receivers, (even more) linux commands, vim, OpenCV, blob detection, guassian blurs,
            sterioscopic cameras, obstacle detection, and working cohesively in a large group. I'm grateful to have learned
            as much as I did and am proud of my critical work.
